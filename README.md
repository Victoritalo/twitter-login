Hello! I'm new into developing (a few weeks) but I want to register every step of mine so here is one of my first projects with HTML and CSS(No ctrl C+V). I'm being mentored by Jessica Tarra and Carol both from DiversificaDev. Also, learning a lot with Gustavo Guanabara videos and lessons!

body {
	  margin: 10px; /* Depending on which device is being used, the screen would cut the forms visibility, so I added a margin of 10px and looks great now! */
	  }
 
 button {
   padding: 15px /*decided to use padding instead height and wdith just to decrease the amount of lines. */
    }
